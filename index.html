          <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Muklek and I am second-year computer science student at the University of Portsmouth.
              Currently, I am leading the <a href="https://www.portaisociety.com" target="_blank"> artificial intelligence and robotics society</a> at my university. 
              As you may have guessed, I am deeply interested in machine intelligence and machine learning amongst other areas. 
              I find fascinating to find the relationship between a problem and finding a right way to solve it through ML.
            </p>
            <p>
              I alongside my studies, I am pushing myself outside my comfort zone by self-learning more advanced concepts in computer science/mathematics. 
              Recently, I started to study artificial intelligence. I use books and online lectures (such as MIT and UC Berkeley).
